# Diabetes_Prediction
In this project, I developed a machine learning based diabetes prediction system using a dataset from Kaggle. Handling missing values and removed outliers. Applied multiple machine learning algorithms, to predict diabetes based on key health indicators such as Age, BMI, Hemoglobin Level, and Blood Glucose Level. Built a web using Flask.
